**Proteomic_Pipeline**

Compiled scripts to enable phyloproteomic analysis suing Snakemake. Should eventually include the download of prerequisites!
1) Dataset Construction 
   Scripts to download proteomic data, transform DNA datasets to protein ones and properly format them.
2) Analysis
   Scripts to assemble a proteomic dataset, format and prepare it for a phylgenetic analysis- including the actual phylogenetic tree creation
   
   
   
To Do list:
   3) Reform (WORKSPACE)---((OG BAM FILES), (FORMATTED BAM FILES), (SPLIT INTO CHROMOSOMES) )
   4) Generate plot for pipeline?
   5) Rerun from start
   6) Extend to custom R scripts
   7) angsd asks if you want to overwrite-> always do?
   8) Alternative path to FASTA files for pre split bam files
   9) Make 'FRMT' files temporary?
