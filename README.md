**Proteomic_Pipeline - Under Construction!**

**What is it?**

Compiled scripts to enable phyloproteomic analysis suing Snakemake.

1) Dataset Construction (Working check bellow for instalation)
   Scripts to download proteomic data, transform DNA datasets to protein ones and properly format them.
2) Analysis (Under development)
   Scripts to assemble a proteomic dataset, format and prepare it for a phylgenetic analysis- including the actual phylogenetic tree creation
   
   
**Instalation - User Guide**

This guide assumes that you are working on a Linux enviroment, preferably a server. It should potentially work on a personal computer and even a Macintosh enviroment but I would suggest not to do that.

Step 1) Conda
First check if you have conda installed on your computer by typing 'conda' in the command line.




Step 2)




   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
**Development To Do list: (Dataset Construction)**
   1) Rename folders?
   2) Dependencies and software: Get slim list of conda env - > split it up to sub env? - Rscript and R?
   3) angsd asks if you want to overwrite-> always do?
   4) Alternative path to FASTA files for pre split bam files
   5) Make 'FRMT' files temporary?
   6) Pre bam file input?
   7) Different use for ancient / modern samples
