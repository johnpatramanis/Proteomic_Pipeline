**Proteomic_Pipeline**

Compiled scripts to enable phyloproteomic analysis suing Snakemake. Should eventually include the download of prerequisites!
1) Dataset Construction 
   Scripts to download proteomic data, transform DNA datasets to protein ones and properly format them.
2) Analysis
   Scripts to assemble a proteomic dataset, format and prepare it for a phylgenetic analysis- including the actual phylogenetic tree creation
