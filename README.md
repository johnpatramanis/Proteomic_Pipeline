**Proteomic_Pipeline - Under Construction!**

What is it?

Compiled scripts to enable phyloproteomic analysis suing Snakemake. Should eventually include the download of prerequisites!
1) Dataset Construction 
   Scripts to download proteomic data, transform DNA datasets to protein ones and properly format them.
2) Analysis
   Scripts to assemble a proteomic dataset, format and prepare it for a phylgenetic analysis- including the actual phylogenetic tree creation
   
   
   
To Do list: (Dataset Construction)
   1) Rename folders?
   2) Dependencies and software: Get slim list of conda env - > split it up to sub env? - Rscript and R?
   3) angsd asks if you want to overwrite-> always do?
   4) Alternative path to FASTA files for pre split bam files
   5) Make 'FRMT' files temporary?
   6) Pre bam file input?
   7) Different use for ancient / modern samples
