Protein FASTA format files will be placed here.
They should correspond to each protein of interest per sample. Note that if anything went wrong in the process a file will have a dummy file in its place (XXXs sequence)
One very common such case is when trying to isolate AMELY from a female sample that has not Y chromosome thus no AMELY, leading to a protein file with missing sequence.
